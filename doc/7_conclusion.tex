\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed a roadmap for bringing end-to-end encryption technology to Zoom Meetings (as that
term is best understood by security experts). At a high level, the approach is simple: use public
key cryptography to distribute a session key to a meeting's participants; and provide increasingly
stronger bindings between public keys and user identities. However, the devil is in the details, as
user identity across multiple devices is a challenging problem, and has user experience
implications. We proposed a phased deployment of E2E security, with each successive stage giving
stronger protections. The crux of the proposal are: (1) delegated authority to SSOs where
applicable; (2) signed chains of cryptographic statements (sigchains) for user devices and contact
lists; and (3) a privacy-preserving ``transparency tree'' to tie them tightly together.

We will continue to incorporate feedback and publish subsequent drafts as we refine, implement and
deploy these ideas.
